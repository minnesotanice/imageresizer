## Single Page Image Editing Application

This project started as a way to contribute to a work project. Having a form as part of the app was just an easy day to test my image editing code to make sure that images were showing up clearly and were centered on the correct size and color cavas.

I plan to add validation to the input fields and a color picker for choosing the canvas color.
